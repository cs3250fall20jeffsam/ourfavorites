GitHub Workflow Activity Part 3: Parts 8-9


1. Squashing commits was difficult. I was not able to get the squash
   to work correctly in the command line. For whatever reason the commits 
   would not show up in the 'todo'. I pushed the commits to the GitHub
   site and sqaushed them from there. (Jeff)
   
2. Resolving conflicts seems easy enough. How they relate to squashing
   commits is unknown, since the system was not working as described in 
   activity. (Jeff)

3. There seemed to be very little difference. Unless there was a conflict
   GitHub was indifferent to squashed vs unsquashed.(Jeff)
